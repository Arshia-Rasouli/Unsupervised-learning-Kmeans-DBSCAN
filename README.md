# Unsupervised learning Country dataset: K-Means vs. DBSCAN Clustering with PCA

## Project Overview

This project is employing unsupervised machine learning techniques. The core objective is to uncover hidden patterns and natural groupings within diverse country development metrics using two prominent clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBSCAN. A key aspect of this analysis involves comparing the insights derived from both algorithms.

In this project, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the complexity of the data. This helps us visualize the clusters more clearly and can also decrease the execution time of the clustering algorithms. We compare the execution times before and after applying PCA.


## Steps involved 
1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**
    * Loading the `Country-data.csv` dataset.
    * Initial exploration of data shape, information, and checking for missing values.

2.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
    * Dropping the 'country' column, as it's a categorical identifier not needed for numerical clustering.

3.  **Feature Scaling:**
    * Applying `StandardScaler` to standardize all numerical features. This is crucial for distance-based clustering algorithms.

4.  **K-Means Clustering on Scaled Data:**
    * Performing K-Means clustering on the raw, scaled data (before PCA).
    * Measuring the execution time for this operation.

5.  **Optimal K Determination (Elbow Method):**
    * Calculating and plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for a range of 'k' values.
    * Identifying the optimal number of clusters (`k=3`) based on the elbow point.

6.  **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:**
    * Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the data's dimensionality to 2 principal components.
    * Analyzing principal component loadings via a heatmap to understand feature contributions.

7.  **Clustering on PCA-Reduced Data:**
    * **K-Means Clustering:** Re-applying K-Means on the 2-dimensional PCA-reduced data.
    * **DBSCAN Clustering:** Applying DBSCAN on the 2-dimensional PCA-reduced data.
    * Measuring and comparing the execution times for both K-Means and DBSCAN after PCA to assess performance gains.

8.  **Visualization and Comparison:**
    * Visualizing the clusters generated by K-Means and DBSCAN in the 2D PCA space.
    * Comparing the distinct clustering patterns and the ability of DBSCAN to identify outliers.
